## About Me
I am a web developer with experience building secure and scalable applications, both in frontend and backend. I am particularly interested in **security, testing, and best practices**, and I enjoy creating clear and well-documented projects.  
I easily adapt to remote and collaborative environments and I am continuously improving my technical skills.
